Explainable AI (XAI)

Overview
Explainable AI (XAI) enhances transparency and interpretability in machine learning models. This project provides tools and techniques to understand, visualize, and explain AI models' decisions, ensuring trust and fairness.

Features
- Model interpretability using SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients
- Feature importance visualization
- Bias and fairness analysis
- Interactive dashboards for AI explanations
- Support for various models: deep learning, tree-based, and classical ML

Technologies Used
- Python
- SHAP, LIME, Captum (for PyTorch models)
- TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Flask/Django (for web integration)
- Docker (for containerization)
