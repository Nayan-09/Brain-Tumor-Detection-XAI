# Explainable AI (XAI)

This directory is dedicated to resources and tools related to Explainable AI (XAI). XAI aims to make the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable, allowing users to gain insights into how models arrive at their conclusions.

## Upcoming Resources

A notebook demonstrating the implementation of XAI techniques will be uploaded soon. This notebook will provide practical examples and guidance on how to apply XAI methods to enhance the interpretability of AI models.

## Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Follow best practices for managing and deploying AI models to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
